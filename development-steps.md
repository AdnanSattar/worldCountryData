# Development steps

## Flags download
The flags were downloaded for free from 
[flagpedia.net](http://flagpedia.net/download) 
In this site, the flags can be downloaded either for free or with a free-will donation ranging from $2 to $19. 

## Convert flags into android drawables
All the flags were converted into drawables from [appicon.co](https://appicon.co/#image-sets)

After conversion, they were added to the android ```res/drawable``` directory
